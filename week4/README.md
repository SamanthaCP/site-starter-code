# Week 4: Build & Deployment

Over the course of the program you have learned how to build websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Then we explored how to use tools like React, Node, and Express to add more functionality and create dynamic web pages. We also learned how to build a database using PostgreSQL to store large data and provide a safe way to protect our data to begin tracking user authentication. This week we will wrap up our Full Stack learning on how to use Heroku to deploy your websites!
